# Minimal Enable Two Factor Authentication (2FA) in FastAPI ðŸš€

This repository contains a minimal implementation of enabling/disabling 2FA in a FastAPI application using [PyOTP](https://pypi.org/project/pyotp/) and [qrcode](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/).

## Features
- **User Signup with Optional MFA**  
  Register a new user with the option to enable MFA. When enabled, the server generates a secret and provisioning URI, and the user can scan the QR code to configure their authenticator app.
  
- **Login with 2FA**  
  After providing valid credentials, if MFA is enabled the user is prompted for an OTP generated by their authenticator app.
  
- **Disable MFA**  
  Users can disable MFA by verifying their password and an OTP. After disabling, they must manually remove the account from their authenticator app.

## What is OTP? ðŸ¤”
OTP (One-Time Password) is a time-based password that is valid for a single login session or transaction. Here's a high-level explanation:


## How It Works:
The OTP is generated using a shared secret between the server and the authenticator app (like Google Authenticator). This secret, combined with the current time, creates a temporary password that typically changes every 30 seconds.


## Why It is Secure:
Even if someone knows your static password, they would also need the current OTP (which is valid for a very short period) to access your account. This significantly enhances security by adding an extra layer of verification.


# Getting Started ðŸ”§

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/agfianf/color-correction
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    - via pip:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - or via uv:
        ```bash
        uv sync
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    cd app
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage ðŸ“²
- Signup with MFA:
    
    Send a POST request to /signup with:
    ```json
    {
        "username": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password",
        "enable_mfa": true
    }
    ```
    Retrieve the provisioning URI from the response. Optionally, access /qrcode/your_username to view the QR code image.

- Login with MFA:
    
    Use /login to verify your username and password. If MFA is enabled, follow up with a POST request to /login-2fa by providing your OTP.

- Disable MFA:
    
    Send a POST request to /disable-mfa with:
    ```json
    {
        "username": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password",
        "token": "your_current_OTP"
    }
    ```
    After receiving a success response for MFA disablement, manually remove the account from your authenticator app.
