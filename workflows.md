## What is OTP? ðŸ¤”
OTP (One-Time Password) is a time-based password that is valid for a single login session or transaction. Here's a high-level explanation:


## How It Works:
The OTP is generated using a shared secret between the server and the authenticator app (like Google Authenticator). This secret, combined with the current time, creates a temporary password that typically changes every 30 seconds.


## Why It is Secure:
Even if someone knows your static password, they would also need the current OTP (which is valid for a very short period) to access your account. This significantly enhances security by adding an extra layer of verification.
